#+TITLE: Bevy Asteroids

This is an Asteroids clone in Bevy. It's purpose is to get me familiar with game development using Bevy.


My starting ideas are that this game is gonna need...

1. A player with
   - x and y movement, can be both at the same time
   - shooting mechanics
   - collision mechanics
   - death (I would gie 3 lives)
2. Asteroids that can
   - move
   - die
   - kill the player
3. Some Other Systems include
   - spawning asteroids
   - having boundaries for the player
   - incrementing the score over time as the player shoots asteroids
